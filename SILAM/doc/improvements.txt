# Oportunities of improve for Silam:


- Cleanning:
	- rm from ./ini all the old/depreciated files. 
        - all scripts should have headers with description of what it does. 
	- separation of concerns in source (organize scripts into folders)
	- remove depreciated items/options in the code:
		+ rm all cmb4 since they are not longer used. 
		+

        - rename scripts with confusing names.
	- too many stdout when running, could it be reduced? (at least in "no-debug" mode)

- "User-interface"
	- dispersion_parameters (grid_parameters) -> put this namelist items inside the control_namelist
	- Define ONLY ONE grid (remove this "duality" of output (grid/levels) options) -> let the user do the post-processing, just give the modeled grid w/chance to cropped it.
	- centralized io module?


- New features/updates
        - Recover INVENTORY source class, as netCDF/grib gridded emissions inputs (CAMS, EDGAR, etc.).
        - MEGAN last version, w/global coverage.
        - FINN  last version, w/global coverage.
	- Define Point, Line and Area sources with different and compact sintax.
		+ POINT: id,wkt,z,h,q  (g/s)  ,w,t,d
		+ LINE : id,wkt,z,h,q (g/s.m) ,w,t  
		+ AREA : id,wkt,z,h,q (g/s.m2),w,t  
        - For time-varying emissions, implement something like:
		+ diurnal_cycle= 
		+ weekly_cycle=
		+ monthly_cycle=
- METEO:
	- GFS? (why not?)
