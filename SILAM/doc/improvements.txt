# Improvements for Silam:

- Cleanning:
   - rm from "./ini/" all the old/depreciated files.
   - all scripts should have headers with description of what it does. Same for procedures.
   - separation of concerns in source code (organize scripts into folders?)
   - remove depreciated items/options in the code:
      + rm cmb4 since since is not longer used.
      + rm acid-basic since is not longer used.
      + rm POP chemistry and depo?
      + box_model.f90?
   - grids_geo.silja.mod.f90: remove gauss krueger and polar stereo grids types?
   - see if geography_tools.silam.mod.f90 is still necesary after proj6?
   - renaming (scripts, functions, subroutines, variables) 
   - reduce stdout while running (at least in "no-debug" mode) <- (CLEANER MSG HANDLER) (add verbose index?)
   - add #ifdef DEGBUG to all the tests routines in silam. So are not taking into acount in a normal compilation.
   - fix earth_radius to earth_radius = 6370000.0. params of WGS-84 ellipsoid (a=6378.1370km, b=6356.7523km, f=(a-b)/a)
   - Define ONLY ONE grid (remove this "duality" of output (grid/levels) options) -> let users do the post-processing, just give the modeled grid w/chance to cropped it.
   - dispersion_parameters (are just grid_parameters) -> put the items of this namelist inside the control_namelist
   - centralized io module? (kind of these supermarket scripts)

- Documentation:
   - UserGuide. 
   - Dev.Guide. (in the future? )

- New features/updates
   - Recover INVENTORY source class, as netCDF/grib gridded emissions inputs (CAMS, EDGAR, etc.).
   - Custom Source Term (Emisions) from ASCII (.csv)?
      + Define Point, Line and Area sources with different and compact sintax.
         + POINT: id,wkt,z,h,q (g/s)    ,w,t,d
         + LINE : id,wkt,z,h,q (g/s.m)  ,w,t  
         + AREA : id,wkt,z,h,q (g/s.m2) ,w,t  
      + For time-varying emissions, implement something like:
         + diurnal_cycle= 
         + weekly_cycle=
         + monthly_cycle=
   - Fires: FINN  last version, w/global coverage.
   - Bio-VOCs: MEGAN last version, w/global coverage.
   - DUST: try Ginoux, AFWA, Shao's.
   - METEO:
      + GFS? (do some research to check if is imposible)
   - Add to namelist a section for "soil & land"? Where one can specify where to take some data, and some options to represent it.
