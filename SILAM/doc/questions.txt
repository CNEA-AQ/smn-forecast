# Q4Ro. After reading the user-manual.

- Does silam has a limit of nucleids/species?
- Does the "landuse data" (refered from the internal setup file) still has to be called?
- Diference between fixed-structure format and namelist-type format of conf files? (or are now all namelist-type format?)
- Has the nucleide decay data been integrated in the nucleide data file? (or anywhere else?) is still needed?
- Ro mentioned that "format" for dates (e.g. %ay4 ) is not updated in the user guide?
- when specifiing a file the <file type> should be always be defined in the grib/netcdf specification file?
- does the interal setup file stil a separated file or is a namelist inside the control file?

Regarding "transformations":
- is PASSIVE equals to "scalar tracer"?
- what are "POP_GENERAL" transformations?
- are there other transformations available (for example CB5)?
- Is there other aerosol_dynamics otherwise of SIMPLE?

Regarding "dispersion parameters":
- Are mainly grid parameters?
- what grid_methods are available? (not in user-guide)
- what vertical_methods are available? (not in user-guide)
- will computations be carried out on the meteo grid, and then interpolated and reprojected according with outfile params?

Regarding emission sources:
- what source types are now supported? (EULERIAN|INVENTORY|VOID_SOURCE|SEA_SALT|DESERT_DUST|POLLEN), what is VOID_SOURCE?
- U-G says that "There are three types of sources supported: bomb source, point source and area source." Is it still true? what about gridded emissions?
- Files needed:
	- DUST:     NETCDF:dust_emis_0  ^dust_emis_0_v3.nc4
	- BIOVOCS:  Megan Global Emis |  OR?  land_use_features_USGS_Eurasia.dat?
	- FIRES:    Fire_MOD_MYD_coll_6__FRP_fake_from_20160330.fs1 ?
	- SEASALT:  eco_collection_water_bodies.ctl.super_ctl       ? (water mask)
        - DMS:      NETCDF:dms_clim dms_lana_2011.nc
		    NETCDF:dms_clim sslt_emission_global_50km.fld.nc
- Are AREA_SOURCES still suported? (source_terms_general.silja.mod.f90:1458)
- Are there specific source_term files with specific item variables for diferent type of emissions (dust, bio_vocs, fires, etc)?



Regarding "cocktails":
- how are related/linked with kpp and chemistry modeling?





Regarding bcon and icon:
- initialization_quantity: complete list of initialized quantities?
- i dont understand par_str in the context of my "toy" run.


Regardom internal setup:
- Is the advection_method_lagrangian defined?
