#"Homework"

- Pick 10 sources, and 10 receptors.

- Run FORWARDS from sources.
- Pick-up the concentrations. For a given time (the time where concentrations are "above" receptors)

- Run BACKWARDS from receptors with same mass.
- Get back the concentrations in the sources.

Compare: I should get 10x10 comparissions.
	-make a xy scatterplot







#Questions about the model






















#USERGUIDE STUFF =================================================================
# Q4Ro. After reading the user-manual.

#Short ones:
#+ Does silam has a limit of nucleids/species?
#	I guess doesnt.
#
#+ Does the "landuse data file" (refered from the internal setup file) still has to be called?
#	No.
#
#- Diference between fixed-structure format and namelist-type format of conf files? (or are now all namelist-type format?)
#	The LIST = <namelist> and END_LIST = <namelist>
#
#- Has the nucleide decay data been integrated in the nucleide data file? (or anywhere else?) is still needed?
#	Yes.
#
#- For ANY file in order to be readed by silam it needs to be specified in the grib/netcdf code table file? <file type>. there are exeptions?
#	Yes.
#	grib code table --> grib name table (diferent approach) 
#
#- does the interal setup file stil a separated file or is a namelist inside the control file?
#	Now is part of the controlfile.
#

#Regarding "transformations":
#- is PASSIVE equals to "scalar tracer"?
#	No. But remove the explanation. 
#
#- Are "POP_GENERAL" (persistent organic poluts.)  transformations still available? 
#	No. (chemistry_manager.silam.mod.f90)
#
#- Are there other transformations available (for example CBM5)?
#	Yes. (from chemistry_manager.silam.mod.f90)
#	Full list: 
#         - `PASSIVE` 
#         - `POLLEN` 
#         - `PM_GENERAL` 
#         - `DMAT_SULPHUR`
#         - `ACID_BASIC`
#         - `CB5_SOA`
#         - `CB5_STRATO_SOA` 
#         - `RADIOACTIVE`

#- Is there other aerosol_dynamics otherwise of SIMPLE?
#	Yes, full list: 'NONE' 'SIMPLE' 'MIDDLE_ATMOSPHERE' 'BASIC' 'VBS'    (from chemistry_manager.silam.mod.f90)
# 	VBS goes with SOA
#	Remove BASIC

#Regarding "dispersion parameters":
#- Are mainly grid parameters?
#	Yes. (So why there are calling dispersio params?)

#- what grid_methods are available? (not in user-guide)
#     METEO_GRID/CUSTOM_GRID  !AREA_BASED/EMIS_GRID/

#- what vertical_methods are available? (not in user-guide)
#    `OUTPUT_LEVELS` it assumes the same vertical levels defined for the output.
#    `METEO_LEVELS`  it assumes the same vertical level as the meteorological files
#    `CUSTOM_LEVELS` the user has to set the levels by defining the following namelists:
#    !remove it `EMIS_LEVELS`    (from emis_file?)
#    !remove it `SURFACE_LEVELS` (from meteo_static?)

#- Area computations carried out ON the meteo grid, and then interpolated and reprojected according with outfile params?
#	Yes. (just a guess)


#Regarding emission sources:
#- what source types are now supported? (EULERIAN|INVENTORY|VOID_SOURCE|SEA_SALT|DESERT_DUST|POLLEN), what is VOID_SOURCE?
#	
#	None. Now is only EULERIAN/LAGRANGIAN   (from source_terms_general.silja.mod.f90)

#- U-G says that "There are three types of sources supported: bomb source, point source and area source." Is it still true? what about gridded emissions?
#       full list:  'AREA_SOURCE_' 'BOMB_SOURCE_' 'FIRE_SOURCE_' 'POINT_SOURCE_' 'POLLEN_SOURCE_' 'BIOGENIC_VOC_SOURCE_' 'VOLCANO_SOURCE_' 'WIND_BLOWN_DUST_' 'SEA_SALT_SOURCE_' 'DMS_SOURCE_' (from source_terms_general.silja.mod.f90)
#
#
#- Files needed:
#	- DUST:     NETCDF:dust_emis_0  ^dust_emis_0_v3.nc4
#	- BIOVOCS:  Megan Global Emis |  OR?  land_use_features_USGS_Eurasia.dat?
#	- FIRES:    Fire_MOD_MYD_coll_6__FRP_fake_from_20160330.fs1 ?
#	- SEASALT:  eco_collection_water_bodies.ctl.super_ctl       ? (water mask)
#        - DMS:      NETCDF:dms_clim dms_lana_2011.nc
#		    NETCDF:dms_clim sslt_emission_global_50km.fld.nc
#
#- Are AREA_SOURCES still suported? 
#	Yes, it is call INVENTORY in the user guide. (source_terms_general.silja.mod.f90:1458)
#
#- Are there specific source_term files with specific *ITEMS* variables for diferent type of emissions (dust, bio_vocs, fires, etc)?
#	Yes. (tell me what does changes, or where can i found it)
#
#
#---
#
#Regarding "cocktails":
#	
#- how are related/linked with kpp and chemistry modeling?
#
#
#Regarding bcon and icon:
#- initialization_quantity: complete list of initialized quantities?
#- i dont understand par_str in the context of my "toy" run.
#
#
##Regarding internal setup:
##- Is the advection_method_lagrangian item defined anywhere in the code defined?	dont mention it in the ug.
