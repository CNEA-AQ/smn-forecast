! In this file the mapping between input data for boundaries and transport species should be described. 
! One header file describes mapping for one homogeneous set of input files(same format, vertical, 
! boundaries to be served). If a link is included in tis mapping, it is assumed that data for it exists in the input 
! files and a target in transport cocktail. If not, an error will occure.
! Control file points to as many header files as necessary. 
! 
! Each par_strline should have the following fields:
! par_str = <boundary_species_subst_name> <boundary_species_mode> <transport_species_subst_name> <transport_species_mode> <factor>
! Factor is a multiplier for concentration in boundary file (fraction if one boundary species contributes to more 
! than one transport species etc.) There can be several lines for one boundary species and also for one transport species.
